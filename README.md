# Pixel Art Maker Project

This project was undertaken as the final project and part of the #7daysofcode to mark the successful completion of my Udacity Scholarship courtesy of Andela Learning community.

It has been a great journey so far and it can only get better from here. 

This project was a bit challenging as I had to use Javascript and JQuery which I had never used before (though honestly I found understanding these 2 to be quite interesting).

i hope to improve on this in the nearest future as I hone my newly developed skills and look forward to the next phase of the Nanodegree program!
